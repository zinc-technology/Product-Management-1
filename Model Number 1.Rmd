## Situation

Approximately 25% of the a product's user-base (~42K) use the product, at least, once a month. However, given the nature of the service, where privacy is paramount, advertising revenue or selling user information aren't a part of the business model. Optional support tiers are available for users to consider, but this business model has failed to sustain operations. There is recognition that a paid subscription or a Product _+_ version is the only way to sustain and grow the business. An attempt at introducing a paid product has met with some success. It is assumed that usability of the product is linked to some of the financial outcomes.

## Task

The client uses a combination of an off-the-shelf solution, along with Google Analytics, to monitor, communicate with, and understand their user base. There are over a 100 individual data points that are being tracked. Our job is to provide a non-partial recommendation on:

* How best to convert the current user base?
* Which existing features to include in a _Freemium_ like offering?
* How best to structure, and link, data-driven research to product development (sustainable & repeatable revenue)?
* How best to expand the user base and expand operations?
* How best to communicate Data results with the client (interpret-ability is key)?

## Action

After several conversations with the client it was decided to create an initial model of the current user base to understand which features were being used and if there was any link of usage to the existing business model.

### Approach

A limit of 20 _usability_ and _financial outcome_ variables were selected (based on the initial conversations with the client) with the aim of performing logistic regression against the financial outcome of interest. A correlogram was created to assist in the visualization of data.

#### Corr-plot

After some data wrangling which involved the handling _NAs_ and converting variables into _factors_ the following corr-plot was observed.

* Understanding the corr-plot call
    + _scale_ while not strictly required for the cor() call, it is included here because we intend to use hierarchical clustering to order the grid.
    + _order = hclust_ [Datacamp Tutorial on Heirarchical Clustering](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/hierarchical-clustering-R) 
        + This was done to arrange the data using a clustering algorithm so that features used be grouped together to better understand user behavior.
    + The remainder of the arguments are cosmetic - [Link to package on cran](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html)



```{r corrplot, echo=TRUE}
df_mini <- readRDS("article_data")
df_mini %>% scale() %>% cor() %>% corrplot(order = "hclust", hclust.method = "average",
                                            method = "color", diag = F,
                                            tl.col = "gray20",
                                            sig.level = T, addCoef.col = "white",
                                            number.cex = .6, type = "upper",
                                            tl.cex = 0.8)
```

#### Interpretation of the corr-plot
    
* What does the corr-plot do?
    + The corr-plot visualizes correlations between variables and provides a correlation co-efficient (optional) for each pair of potentially correlated variables.
    + The dark blue color indicates high positive correlation, contrasted with the dark reds that indicate high negative correlation.

* Salient Features of this Corr-plot (Clustering)
    + _Financial Products 1, 2 and 3_ cluster together
    + _Usage_ and _Frequency of Usage_ characteristics cluster together
    + However, there doesn't seem to be an overlap between _Financial Products_ and _Usage_.
    
* Salient Features of this Corr-plot (Correlation)
    + _Financial product 2_ is highly correlated to _Financial product 3_.
        + Buyer of one product likely buys the other.
    + _Usage Characteristic 1_ is highly correlated to _Usage Characteristic 5_.
        + Does one behavior lead to the other?
    + _Primary users_ are somewhat correlated to _Social users_ (think some users have followers). 
        + Should _followers_ be a paid feature?
    + The correlations between _Frequency users_ and _User characteristics 1 and 5_ should be explored. 
        + Who are the power users and what to they like doing? Note, from above _Usage characteristics 1 & 5_ are highly correlated.
    + _Financial Outcome_ is poorly correlated to _Frequency_ and _Usage_.
    

#### Logistic Regression

```{r logistic regression, echo=TRUE}
#Create a General Linear Model with glm()
Logistic_model <- glm(Fin_outcome ~ ., family = "binomial", data = df_mini)
summary(Logistic_model)
```

#### Interpretation of Logistic Regression

The output of a logistic regression can be confusing because it describes the log-odds of something binary (yes/no) occurring. For example, a per unit increase in _Usage Characteristic 2_ increases the log odds of _Financial Outcome_ by 1.097e-02. This doesn't make sense to most people. However, we can transform log-odds into regular likelihood by calculating the exponential of the _Estimate_.

```{r likelihood, echo=TRUE}
# Transform coefficients / Log - odds to interpret data
likelihood <- coef(Logistic_model) %>% exp() %>% round(2)
likelihood
```


#### Interpretation of Likelihood

* There is no increase or decrease in the likelihood of belonging to the class _Financial Outcome_ based on whether the user is a _Primary User_ or not.
* If a user has purchased _Financial Product 1_ then they are 3.89 times more likely to be a member of the _Financial Outcome_ class as compared to a user who has not purchased _Financial Product 1_.
    + Similarly, those that prefer _Communication Methodology 2_ are 6.3 times as likely to be a member of the class _Financial Outcome_.

#### Refining the Model

Removing insignificant variables using StepAIC()

```{r StepAIC}
trimmed_model <- stepAIC(Logistic_model, trace = 0)
trimmed_formula <- as.formula(summary(trimmed_model)$call)
trimmed_formula
```

New Model Likelihoods

```{r New Model}
New_model <- glm(trimmed_formula, family = "binomial", data = df_mini)
summary(New_model)
likelihood_new <- coef(New_model) %>% exp() %>% round(2)
likelihood_new
```

R2 - Goodness of Fit - Equivalents for Logistic regression

```{r R2 equivalents}
LogRegR2(New_model)
```

#### Interpretation of the Goodness of Fit

Generally a fit below 0.2 is considered poor. In other words, while the model may be significant as indicated by the p-values, the explanation of variation in the underlying model is not good enough.

#### Additional refinement of the model

It was decided to create a model of only those users that preferred _Communication Preference 2_. It was recognized that focusing on these users would, effectively, half the target audience, however, focusing on a narrower but potentially predictable audience was considered an acceptable trade-off.

```{r Narrow Focus, echo=FALSE}
df_mini_2 <- df_mini %>% dplyr::filter(Comm_pref_2 > 0) %>% dplyr::select(-Comm_pref_2)

Logistic_model_2 <- glm(Fin_outcome ~ ., family = "binomial", data = df_mini_2)

trimmed_model_2 <- stepAIC(Logistic_model_2, trace = 0)
trimmed_formula_2 <- as.formula(summary(trimmed_model_2)$call)

New_model_2 <- glm(trimmed_formula_2, family = "binomial", data = df_mini_2)
```

```{r New Model 2}
summary(New_model_2)
```

New Likelihood of only those who chose Communication Preference 2
```{r New Likelihood}
coef(New_model_2) %>% exp() %>% round(2)
```

Refined Goodness of Fit

```{r Refined Goodness of Fit}
LogRegR2(New_model_2)
```
#### Even more refinement?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
message("How many users engage in Financial Product 1?")
df_mini %>% filter(Fin_prod_1 > 0) %>% count()
```
There aren't enough users to make a business case.

## Result

To re-cap, we've performed three methods of data - analysis, which I'll argue are being used as exploratory methods.

The hierarchical clustering resulted in a some-what neat division of users who self-aggregated into:

* Those that use / purchase Financial products 1, 2, and 3.
* Those that behave in the manner as described by Usage Characteristics 1 and 5
* Those that behave in the manner of Usage Characteristics 2 and 4
* A small cluster around Primary and Secondary users.
* Finally, there doesn't seem to be any clustering around Financial Outcome.

The correlogram supports the interest in the clustering of Financial Products, and Usage Characteristics 1 and 5, along with the apparent randomness of Financial Outcome.

Finally, the logistic regression suggests that the likelihood of _Financial Outcome_ could be based on the presence or absence of behaviors associated with _Financial Product 1_ and _Communication Preference 2_.

However, the goodness of fit indices for the model of all users indicated that it wasn't a very good model. 

To improve the model it was decided to focus on those users who preferred _Communication Preference 2_, however, after creating and trimming the new logistic model, the goodness of fit indices still indicated that the model didn't do a good job of explaining why users engaged in _Financial Outcome_.

Further refinement of the model was not considered because the cohort of users engaged with _Financial Product 1_ was deemed too small.

The final conclusion reached was that the _Financial Outcome_ of interest occurred in a way that currently captured variables were not able to model.


## Talk (with the Client)

We went back and presented our results. After some discussion. The Product Owners believed that a combination of certain _Usability Behaviors_ (being measured) in conjunction with a _Value Proposition 1_ (not being measured) was key to _Financial Outcome_.

## SMART Goals

* A/B Test  _Communication Preference 2_ and _Communication Preference 2_ with respect to establishing a cohort of those that agree with _Value Proposition 1_

* Seek _Financial Outcome_ behavior and compare cohorts of those that agree and disagree with _Value Proposition 1_ as a means to create a baseline for future product iterations.

## Learnings

* In typical MBA fashion, I'm calling this process STAR - T - SMART.
* Product Owners / Start-up Founders have a strong sense of, qualitatively, why users engage in behavior but it is important to prevent them from being blind-sided by data.
* Measuring _Behavior_ or _Value Propositions_ is needed to link to financial outcomes.
